PG Bundle - All you need is Postgres

I'm a huge fan of PostgreSQL. It's an open source RDBMS that makes MongoDB obsolete.
But lack of information for new people who are in the beginning of their career makes it hard to get started with PostgreSQL and let MongoDB take that big slice of users.

I decided to start a small project called `PG Bundle`_

What is PG Bundle? It's a single page that you can share with friends or coworkers to let them get started with PostgreSQL.
It's going to have a human mantained page with links to all necessary infromation for beginners, as well as professionals who are looking for efficient tools for work with PostgreSQL.

You can find me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/inablackcar if you want to share any information, or help with the project.
