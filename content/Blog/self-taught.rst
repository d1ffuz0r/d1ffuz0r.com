I'm don't believe that stars on stackoverflow could help you get a job, they can give you attention of recruiters, not more. Same and Github.
Before a large count of the interviews in soon, now is a good time to refresh knowledge.
My check list to read&watch&learn for the next 1 - 2 months:

* Get that job at Google http://steve-yegge.blogspot.ch/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html
* "Cracking the Coding Inverview" Book
* "Data Structures And Algorithms Alfred V. Aho" Book
* CS Berkley course https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/computer-science-162-001-spring/id596646529?l=en&mt=10
* "Analysis of Algorithms" at Coursera
