It's a time for to improve my English! Let's talk about HAML, SASS, Coffeescript now!

Long time i like try Coffeescript in action, and in that weekend I did it. It look better than pure JavaScript, as the mixture from Python, Ruby and Haskell of languages. Now write on the "js" was nice.
Also I `dived` in HAML and SASS :D With they I can write less code than css and html, with closing each tag. For example, all templates this site have been https://github.com/d1ffuz0r/d1ffuz0r.tk/commit/116da7d2edbfb9fe6a7509d928606d0d0dd2fb72 was rewritten on HAML, with using libraries djaml and hamlpy. for python exists good library for work with HAML -> hamlpy optimized for templates like Django-templates and Jinja2. But for SASS i not have found also excellent library. All of exists libraries are support only SCSS, but not SASS. And so I use native tool written on Ruby.

If code, written on JavaScript makes you angry, look at Coffescript, and your view to change.
