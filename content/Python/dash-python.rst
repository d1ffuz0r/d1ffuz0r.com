Such awesome app, Dash. I heard about it app, but my laziness has not given to try one.
Finally I have tried it recently with `dash-at-point` mode for Emacs. Easy access to help by one hot-key,
without permanent switching to browser, support of bunch libraries and languages.  But unfortunately Dash.app has documentation only several python libraries.
So I decided to make generator for fast building docsets(this is format of library for Dash.app) from list of libraries what in any storage.
The big lucky was to find on website of Dash developer way to publish new documentation.
It was so easy, just archive docset and make xml file, and everyone can add this feed to app and automatically get updates without checking website.
And I want to introduce a website where I going to publish some docsets for popular libraries
from Python world: http://python-dashapp.tk. There are already several libraries, like SQLAlchemy, WebOb, Flask, peewee, fabric.
You can always write to me in twitter (link in footer this website) to request new libraries for support.
